# Healthcare Patient Data – Historical Outcomes Analysis

This project supports **historical analysis of our patient population** and how **health outcomes have changed over time**. As a health insurance provider, we use this data to understand trends in demographics, utilization, conditions, and outcomes—enabling evidence-based decisions about care quality, risk, and population health management.

## Key Findings

**Healthcare utilization and cost growth are increasingly driven by chronic, behavioral, and preventable conditions rather than acute illness.** Moderate-risk members account for the highest utilization burden, while gaps in adult preventive care and behavioral health management continue to drive avoidable encounters. These findings highlight opportunities for earlier intervention, targeted care management, and preventive investment to improve outcomes and reduce long-term claims growth.

### Population Health Trends

The most prevalent conditions include stress, social isolation, obesity, and respiratory infections—reflecting behavioral and social risk factors rather than isolated clinical events. Health Index outcomes vary by condition: poorer outcomes are associated with neurological injury, substance-related conditions, and recurrent trauma, while acute, resolvable conditions show higher health outcomes. Cost growth is increasingly driven by upstream behavioral and social risk rather than episodic medical events.

### Risk Accumulation and Aging

Condition burden increases steadily with age, with sharp acceleration in midlife (40s–70s). Rising diagnosis rates over time reflect improved detection, expanded access, and an aging population. The pace of condition accumulation is a strong indicator of future utilization and underscores the importance of early identification of members with rapidly escalating risk.

### Utilization Concentration

Moderate-risk members exhibit the longest encounter durations and highest healthcare engagement. Utilization peaks before members transition into the highest-risk category, indicating that this segment represents a critical intervention point to prevent progression into more costly health states.

### Behavioral Health as a Cost Driver

Mental health screenings, substance use assessments, and general health evaluations account for a substantial share of procedures across all risk categories. Behavioral health is tightly interconnected with stress, obesity, social isolation, and chronic disease progression, amplifying both utilization and downstream medical complexity.

### Preventive Care Gaps

Preventive encounters are associated with higher Health Index scores; urgent and emergency encounters cluster among lower-health populations. Vaccination uptake is strong in childhood but declines markedly in adulthood, coinciding with rising encounters for preventable diseases. Missed preventive care continues to drive avoidable utilization and worse outcomes.

### Allergies and Environmental Exposure

Food and environmental allergies account for the majority of allergic reactions and are linked to respiratory and dermatologic conditions. Recurring encounters could be reduced through earlier identification, patient education, and proactive management of environmental triggers.

## Strategic Implications

Sustainable cost control depends on early identification of rising risk, prioritizing moderate-risk members, integrating behavioral health into care management, and improving adult preventive care adherence. The Health Index stands out as a strong early signal of future utilization and should be incorporated into risk stratification and care management workflows.

Improving outcomes and controlling long-term cost growth will require proactive population health strategies that intervene earlier, target rising-risk members, and invest in preventive and behavioral health care.
